This Python script uses TensorFlow and Keras to build a text classification model. The model is trained on a dataset of news articles and their corresponding categories, with the goal of predicting the category of a news article based on its content.

The script begins by importing necessary libraries and modules. It sets the TensorFlow logging level to '3' to suppress most of the TensorFlow logs. It then imports TensorFlow, pandas for data manipulation, sklearn for splitting the dataset, and Keras for text preprocessing.

The script reads a CSV file named 'news-classification.csv' into a pandas DataFrame. The 'content' column, which contains the text of the news articles, is separated into a variable named 'texts'. The 'category_level_1' column, which contains the categories, is separated into a variable named 'labels'. The labels are then one-hot encoded using pandas' `get_dummies` function.

The script then splits the dataset into training and testing sets using sklearn's `train_test_split` function. The test size is set to 20% of the total dataset.

The script tokenizes the texts using Keras' `Tokenizer`. It sets the number of words to keep, based on word frequency, to 10,000, and assigns an out-of-vocabulary token for words that aren't among the top 10,000. The tokenizer is then fit on the training texts.

The script converts the texts into sequences of integers using the tokenizer. It then pads these sequences to a maximum length of 100 using Keras' `pad_sequences` function. Sequences shorter than 100 are padded with zeros at the end, and sequences longer than 100 are truncated at the end.

The script then defines a sequential model with an Embedding layer, a GlobalAveragePooling1D layer, a Dense layer with ReLU activation, and a final Dense layer with softmax activation. The number of units in the final Dense layer is equal to the number of unique labels in the dataset. The model is compiled with the 'adam' optimizer and the 'categorical_crossentropy' loss function, suitable for multi-class classification.

The model is then trained for 10 epochs using the padded training sequences and the training labels. The padded testing sequences and the testing labels are used as validation data.

After training, the script evaluates the model on the testing data and prints the loss and accuracy. It then uses the model to make predictions on the testing data and prints these predictions.
